A significant part of the pandemic response has relied greatly on data analysis, as there is always new information being discovered about the virus. However, one issue that the Center for Disease Control has indicated is that there are a lot of holes in data on COVID cases and deaths by race and ethnicity, whether there be many unreported statistics or complete datasets missing related to race.

Our goal with this web application is to begin to bridge the holes created by missing racial data, specifically in North Carolina counties, expanding the resources that could be used to catalyze more equal decisions of COVID response resource allocation in terms of racial communities. We did so through the analysis of racial population distribtution in NC by county alongside the
